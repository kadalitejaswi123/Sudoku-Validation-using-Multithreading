# Sudoku Validation using Multithreading 

A multithreaded Sudoku validator built using `pthreads` in C/C++, implemented as part of the Operating Systems course at IIT Hyderabad.

---

## Features

- âœ… Validates Sudoku boards (9x9, 16x16, 36x36)
- Parallelized using POSIX threads
- Multiple scheduling strategies:
  - Static Chunk Scheduling
  - Static Mixed Scheduling
  - Dynamic: TAS, CAS, and Bounded CAS

## Input Format

Your input file should be named `inp.txt` and contain:

<NUM_THREADS> <SUDOKU_SIZE>
<row1 elements>
<row2 elements>
...


âœ… Example:

8 36
7 6 5 3 8 2 1 ... (continues for 36x36 grid)

## Compilation & Execution

ðŸ”¹ Sequential Validator

gcc -o sequential src/sequential.c -lm
./sequential

ðŸ”¹ Chunk Scheduler

gcc -o chunk src/chunk.c -pthread -lm
./chunk

ðŸ”¹ Mixed Scheduler

gcc -o mixed src/mixed.c -pthread -lm
./mixed

ðŸ”¹ Extra Credit: Dynamic Scheduling (TAS/CAS)

gcc -o extracredit src/extracredit.c -pthread -lm
./extracredit

ðŸ“Š Sample Output

Thread 1 checks row 1: valid
Thread 2 checks column 1: valid
...
Sudoku is valid.
Time taken: 10520 microseconds

ðŸ“ˆ Performance Analysis
Performance is benchmarked by measuring execution time across:

Different thread counts (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16)

Different input sizes (9x9, 16x16, 36x36)

Different schedulers
